\maketitle

This is a short description of the course. It should give a little flavour of what the course is about, and what will be roughly covered in the notes.

This article constitutes my notes for the `Non-Existent' course, held in Hillary 2052 at Cambridge. These notes are \emph{not a transcription of the lectures}, and differ significantly in quite a few areas. Still, all lectured material should be covered.
