\section{Basic notions}
Recall definitions in $\mathbb{C}$ from IA courses. Note that $d (z,w)=|z-w|$ defines a metric on $\mathbb{C}$ (the standard metric). For $a \in \mathbb{C}$ and $r >0$, we write $D (a,r)= \left\{z \in \mathbb{C}: \ |z-a|<r \right\}$ for the open ball with centre $a$ and radius $r$. 
\begin{definition}[Open subset of $\mathbb{C}$]
     A subset $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ is open wrt. the standard metric if for all $a \in U$, there exists an $r$ such that $D (a,r) \in U$.
\end{definition} 
\begin{remark}
     This is equivalent to being open wrt. the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^{2} $.
\end{remark}

This course is about complex valued functions of a single variable, i.e functions \[
f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, \quad \text{where } A \subset \mathbb{C}
.\] 
Identifying $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the usual way, we can write $f=u+iv$ for real functions $u,v$ and thus define $u= \operatorname{Re} (f)$, $v=\operatorname{Im} (f)$. 
Almost exclusively we'll focus on differentiable functions $f$. But first let's recall continuity. 
\begin{definition}[Continuous function on $\mathbb{C}$]
     The function $f$ (as above) is continuous at a point $w \in A$ if \[
     \forall \varepsilon >0, \ \exists \delta >0 \text{ such that } \forall z \in A,\quad  |z-w|<\delta \implies |f (z)- f (w)| <\varepsilon
     .\] 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
     This is equivalent to saying that $\lim_{z \rightarrow w} f(z)=f (w) $. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Complex differentiation}
Let $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, where $U$ is open. 
\begin{definition}[Differentiability]
     $f$ is differentiable at $w \in U$ if the limit \[
     f' (w)=\lim_{z \rightarrow w} \frac{f (z)-f (w)}{z-w}
     .\] exists at a complex number.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Holomorphic function]
     $f$ is holomorphic at $w \in U$ if there is $\varepsilon >0$ such that $D (w, \varepsilon)\subset U$ and $f$ is differentiable at every point in $D (w, \varepsilon)$. 

     Equivalently, $f$ is holomorphic in $U$ if $f$ is holomorphic at every point in $U$, or equivalently, $f$ is differentiable at every point in $U$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
     Sometimes we use "analytic" to mean holomorphic.
\end{remark}
Usual rules of differentiation of real functions of a real variable hold for complex functions. Derivatives of sums, products, quotients of functions are obtained in the same way (can easily be checked). 

\begin{proposition}
     The chain rule for composite functions also holds: if $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, $g: V \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with $f (U) \subset V$, and $h= g \circ f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. If $f$ is differentiable at $w \in U$ and $g$ is differentiable at $f (w)$, then $h$ is differentiable at $w$ with \[
     h' (w)=(g \circ f)' (w)= f' (w) (g' \circ f)(w)
     .\] 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
     Omitted; analagous to the proof for the real case.
\end{proof}
We might ask ourselves a question: 

Write $f (z)= u (x,y)+iv (x,y)$, $z=x+iy$. Is differentiability of $f$ at a point $w=c+id \in U$ is the same as differentiability of $u $ and $v$ at $(c,d)$? 

Recall from IB Analysis \& Topology that $u : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $(c,d) \in U$ if there is a "good linear approximation of $u$ at $(c,d)$". We can show that if  $u$ is differentiable at $c,d$ then $L$ (the derivative of $u$ at $(c,d)$) is uniquely defined, and we write $L=Du (c,d)$; moreover, $L$ is given by the partial derivatives of $u$, i.e \[
L (x,y)= \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} (c,d)\right)x + \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(c,d)\right)y
.\]  

The answer to the above question is \textbf{no} (otherwise complex analysis would be useless!). Now we want to characterise differentiability of $f$ in terms of $u$ and $v$. 

\begin{theorem}[Cauchy-Riemann equations]
     This theorem states that $f=u+iv: \ U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is differentiable at $w=c+id \in U$ if and only if 

     $u,v$ are differentiable at $(c,d) \in U$ \textbf{and} $u,v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations at $(c,d)$: \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=- \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
     .\]  
     If $f$ is differentiable at $w=c+id$, then \[
     f' (w)= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} (c,d)+i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} (c,d)
     .\]  There are three other such expressions following from the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
     $f$ is differentiable at $w$ with derivative $f' (w)=p+iq$:
     \begin{align*}
         \iff & \lim_{z \rightarrow w} \frac{f (z)- f (w)}{z-w}=p+iq\\
         \iff & \lim_{z \rightarrow w} \frac{f (z)- f (w)- (z-w)(p+iq)}{|z-w|}=0\\
     \end{align*}
     Writing $f=u+iv$ and separating real and imaginary parts, the above holds if and only if 
     \begin{align*}
        & \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (c,d)} \frac{u (x,y)- u (c,d)-p (x-c)+q (y-d)}{\sqrt{(x-c)^2+ (y-d)^2}}=0\\
        \text{and } & \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (c,d)} \frac{v (x,y)- v (c,d)-q (x-c)+p (y-d)}{\sqrt{(x-c)^2+ (y-d)^2}}=0\\
     \end{align*}
     This is precisely the statement that $u$ is differentiable at $(c,d)$ with $Du (c,d)(x,y)=px-qy$, and $v$ is differentiable at $(c,d)$ with $Dv (c,d)(x,y)=qx+py$. 

     So $\iff$ $u,v$ are differentiable at $(c,d)$ and $u_{x}(c,d)=p=v_{y}(c,d)$, $u_{y}(c,d)=-q=-v_{x}(c,d)$, i.e the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold at $(c,d)$. 

     We also get from the above that if $f$ is differentiable at $w$, then $f' (w)=p+iq=u_{x}(c,d)+iv_{x} (c,d)$.  
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
     $u,v$ satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations at a point does \textbf{not} guarantee differentiability of $f$ on its own. We also can proceed in a more simple way if we simply want to show the reverse implication, by writing \[
     f' (w)=\lim_{z \rightarrow w} \frac{f (z)- f (w)}{z-w}=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f (w+h)-f (w)}{h}
     ,\]
     and then choosing $h = t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $h=it$ (since we can choose any direction we want for $h$) in order to get that $u_{x},u_{y},v_{x},v_{y}$ exist and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.   
\end{remark}
\begin{example}[Differentiability (?) of conjugation map]
      Let $f (z)=\overline{z} =x-iy$. For this, $u =x, v=-1$, so $u_{x}=1, v_{y}=-1$ and so the C-R equations are not satisfied and $f$ is not differentiable at any point.  
\end{example}
\begin{corollary}
     Let $f=u+iv: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. If $u,v$ have continuous partial derivatives at $(c,d) \in U$ and satisfy the C-R equations there, then $f$ is differentiable at $w=c+id$.
     
     In particular, if $u,v$ are $\mathbb{C}^{1}$ functions on $U$ (i.e have continuous partial derivatives in $U$) satisfying the C-R equations in $U$, then $f$ is holomorphic in $U$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
      Continuity of partial derivatives of $u$ implies that $u$ is differentiable, and similarly for $v$ (IB Analysis \& Topology). So the corollary follows from the C-R theorem.
\end{proof}
Complex differentiability is much more restrictive than real differentiability of real and imaginary parts (because of the additional requirement that the Cauchy-Riemann equations must hold). This leads to surprising theorems compared to the real case, for example 
\begin{itemize}
     \item[(a)] If $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and bounded, then $f$ is constant! (Liouville's theorem). This is false for real functions; for example $\sin (x): \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . 
     \item[(b)] If $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic, then $f$ is infinitely differentiable on $U$.  
\end{itemize}
We will prove these later on. Note that (b) implies that partial derivatives of $u,v$ of all orders exists. So we can differentiate the Cauchy-Riemann equations to get: 
\begin{align*}
     &(u_{x})_x=(v_{y})_x \implies u_{xx}=v_{yx} \text{  and} \\
     &(u_{y})_y=(-v_{x})_y \implies u_{yy}=-v_{xy}.
\end{align*} 
This gives $\nabla^2 u=u_{xx}+u_{yy}=0$ in $U$. Similarly $\nabla^2 v=0$ in $U$.

This means that real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic function are harmonic. This gives a deep connection between harmonic functions and complex analysis; some theorems can be viewed as giving results about harmonic functions. 

Now we need some definitions before the next corollary.
\begin{definition}
      \begin{enumerate}
           \item A curve is a continuous map $\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, where $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a closed interval. We say $\gamma$ is a $C^{1}$ curve if $\gamma'$ exists and is continuous on $[a,b]$. 
           \item An open set $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ is path-connected if for any two points $z,w \in U$, there is a curve $\gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow U$ such that $\gamma (0)=z$ and $\gamma (1)=w$. 
           \item A domain is a non-empty, open, path-connected subset of $\mathbb{C}$.  
      \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{corollary}
     If $U \in C$ is a domain and $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic with $f' (z)=0$ for every $z \in U$, then $f$ is constant.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
      Write $f=u+iv$. By the C-R equations, $f'=0 \implies Du=Dv=0$ in $U$. Since $U$ is a domain, this means (IA Analysis and Topology) that $u$ and $v$ are constant, i.e $f$ is constant.
\end{proof}
Now we want to look at some examples of holomorphic functions other than polynomials on $\mathbb{C}$ and rational functions on their domains. We now look at power series, which will give us a wealth of examples. 

\subsection{Power series}
Recall the next theorem from IA Analysis:
\begin{definition}[Radius of convergence]
      If $(c_{n})_{n=0}^{ \infty}$ is a sequence of complex numbers, then there is a unique number $R \in [0, \infty]$ such that the power series \[
      \sum_{n=0}^{ \infty}c_{n}(z-a)^{n} \qquad z,a \in \mathbb{C}
      .\] 
      converges absolutely if $|z-a|<R$ and diverges if $|z-a|>R$. If $0<r<R$, then the series converges uniformly wrt $z$ on the compact disk $D_{r}=\left\{z \in \mathbb{C}: \ |z-a|<R\right\}$. 

      We call $R$ the radius of convergence of the power series. Note that when $z=R$, we cannot say anything in general about convergence.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
      Let $\sum_{n=0}^{ \infty}c_{n}(z-a)^{n}$ be a power series with radius of convergence $R>0$. Fix $a \in \mathbb{C}$, and define $f: D (a,R)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $f (z)= \sum_{n=0}^{ \infty}c_{n}(z-a)^{n}$. Then
      \begin{enumerate}
           \item $f$ is holomorphic on $D (a,R)$. 
           \item The derived series $\sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}nc_{n}(z-a)^{n-1}$ also has radius of convergence $R$, and \[
           f' (z)=\sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}nc_{n}(z-a)^{n-1} \quad \forall z \in D (a,R)
           .\] 
           \item $f$ has derivatives of all orders on $D (a,R)$, and $c_{n}= \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$. 
           \item If $f$ vanishes on $D (a, \varepsilon)$ for some $\varepsilon>0$, then $f \equiv 0$ on $D (a,R)$. 
      \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
      \textbf{Parts (i) and (ii)}: By considering $g (z)=f (z+a)$, we assume WLOG that $a=0$. So $f (z)=\sum_{n=0}^{ \infty}c_{n}z^{n}$ for $z \in D (0,R)$. 

     The derived series $\sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}nc_{n}z^{n-1}$ will have some radius of convergence $R_1 \in [0, \infty]$. Now let $z \in D (0,R)$ be arbitrary. Choose $\rho$ such that $|z|<\rho<R$. Then since $n |\frac{z}{\rho}|^{n-1} \rightarrow 0 $ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, we have \[
     n |c_n||z|^{n-1}=n |c_n||\frac{z}{\rho}|^{n-1}\rho^{n-1} \leq |c_n|p^{n-1}
     .\]  
     for sufficiently large $n$. Since $\sum_{}^{}|c_{n}|\rho^{n}$ converges, it follows that $\sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}nc_{n}z^{n-1}$ converges. Thus $D (0,R)\subset D (0,R_1 )$, i.e $R_1 \geq R$. Since \[
     |c_{n}||z|^{n} \leq n|c_{n}||z|^{n}=|z|\left(|c_{n}||z|^{n-1}\right)
     ,\] 
     if $\sum_{}^{}n |c_{n}||z|^{n-1}$ converges then so does $\sum_{}^{}|c_{n}||z|^{n}$, so $R_1 \leq R$. So $R_1 =R$. 
     
     To prove that $f$ is differentiable with $f' (z)=\sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}nc_{n}(z-a)^{n-1}$, fix $z \in D (0,R)$. The key idea is that this is equivalent to continuity at $z$ of the function 
     \begin{equation*}
          g: D (0,R) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, \quad g (w)=
           \begin{cases}
                \frac{f (w)- f (z)}{w-z} & w \neq z\\
                \sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}nc_{n}z^{n-1} & w=z.
           \end{cases}          
     \end{equation*}
     By subbing in $f$ we can write $g (w)=\sum_{n=1}^{ \infty}h_{n}(w)$ where 
     \begin{equation*}
          h_{n} (w)=
          \begin{cases}
               \frac{c_{n}(w^{n}-z^{n})}{w-z} & w \neq z\\
               nc_{n}z^{n-1} & w=z.
          \end{cases}  
     \end{equation*}
     Now $h_{n}$ is continuous on $D (0,R)$ (since $w \rightarrow w^{n}$ is differentiable with derivative $nw^{n-1}$). Using $ \frac{w^{n}-z^{n}}{w-z}=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}z^{j}w^{n-1-j}$, we get that for any $r$ with $|z|<r<R$ and any $w \in D (0,r), |h_{n}(w)|\leq n |c_{n}|r^{n-1} \equiv M_{n}$. Since $\sum M_{n} < \infty$, by the Weierstrass M-test that $\sum_{}^{}h_{n}$ converges uniformly on $D (0,r)$. But a uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, so $g = \sum_{}^{}h_{n}$ is continuous in $D (0,r)$ and in particular at $z$.

     \textbf{Part (iii)}: Repeatedly apply (ii). The formula $c_{n}= \frac{f^{(n)(a)}}{n!}$ follows by differentiating the series $n$ times and setting $z=a$. 
     
     \textbf{Part (iv)}: If $f=0$ in $D (a, \varepsilon)$, then $f^{(n)}(a)=0$ for all $n$, so $c_{n}=0$ for all $n$ and hence $f=0$ in $D (a,R)$. 
\end{proof}
If $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic on all of $\mathbb{C}$, we say $f$ is entire. 

\begin{proposition}
      The complex exponential function is defined by \[
      e^{z}= \operatorname{exp}(z)= \sum_{n=0}^{ \infty} \frac{z^{n}}{n!}
      .\] 
      \begin{itemize}
           \item[(i)] $e^{z}$ is entire, with $(e^{z})'=e^{z}$. 
           \item[(ii)] $e^{z} \neq 0$ and $e^{z+w}=e^{z}e^{w}$ for all $z,w \in \mathbb{C}$.
           \item[(iii)] $e^{x+iy}=e^{x}(\cos (y)+i sin (y))$ for $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$. 
           \item[(iv)] $e^{z}=1$ iff $z=2n \pi i$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
           \item[(v)] Let $z \in \mathbb{C}$. There exists $w \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $e^{w}=z$ iff $z \neq 0$.  
      \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
     \textbf{Part (i):} The r.o.c of the series is $ \infty$. To see $(e^{z}=z'),$ differentiate the series term by term using the previous theorem. 

     \textbf{Part (ii):} Fix any $w \in \mathbb{C}$ and set $F (z)= e^{z+w}e^{-z}$. Then $F' (z)=-e^{z+w}e^{-z}+e^{z+w}e^{-z}=0$, so $F(z)$ is a constant. Thus $F (z)=F (0)=e^{w}$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$. Thus \[
     e^{z+w}e^{-z}=e^{w} \quad \forall z,w \in \mathbb{C}
     .\] Taking $w=0$, $e^{z}e^{-z}=1$. So $e^{z} \neq 0$. Multiplying by $e^{z}$, we get $e^{z+w}=e^{z}e^{w}$. 

     \textbf{Part (iii):} $e^{x+iy}=e^{x}e^{iy}$ by (ii). Now use the definition of $e^{iy}$, and the series for $\sin (y), \cos (y)$ for $y \in \mathbb{R}$.

     \textbf{Part (iv) and (v):} Follow from (iii). (Exercise)
\end{proof}
